# Cricket-Score-Display
A program, displays cricket game scores and keeps them as record.

Program can be a bit mistaken. I'm trying to fix bugs.

Instructions :
1. First enter the name of two playing teams
2. Enter the First Team's Bowler's name
3. Please do not enter no. of overs or score in character form
4. Enter six scores of Bowler's. That will be wicket score.
5. After that press any key to next step.
6. Enter Batsman's names for First Team. Program will ask for just three player
7. Then program will ask you batsman's scores. Enter scores correctly.
8. Be careful with the points. Runs points should be 1, 4 and 6.
9. When done with First Team,press any key. Do the same process for Second Team.
10. After all, program will display the total score in a table.

BONUS : THAT PROGRAM CAN RECORD YOUR SCORES IN TXT FILE.
